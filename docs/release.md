# Release

How a version of this package is cut, and what a release has to carry.

## Versioning

Semantic versioning. While pre-1.0 the minor position carries breaking changes, so consumers pin
with `^0.1`.

`composer.json` declares `branch-alias` `dev-main → 0.1.x-dev`, so a path or dev checkout satisfies
a `^0.1` constraint during development.

## Before tagging

- CI green — tests and style — on `main`.
- The naming guard passing, which is what proves no public name regressed to a bare form.
- A `CHANGELOG.md` section for the version, written for a reader deciding whether to upgrade.
- The package installs cleanly from a tag into a fresh Laravel application.

## Cutting the release

```bash
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

The release body is the CHANGELOG section for that version. A release with auto-generated notes or
a "see CHANGELOG" stub is incomplete — the description is part of the release, not a pointer to it.

## Resolution

`laranail/*` packages resolve through git, not Packagist. Consumers add the repositories block from
[installation](installation.md); nothing is pushed to Packagist as part of a release.
