/**
 * Completes a social sign-in for a client with no session, and returns an API token.
 *
 * ## Why this takes an authorization code and not an access token
 *
 * The obvious shape for native social login is "the app does the OAuth dance with the provider's
 * SDK, posts the resulting access token, and the server exchanges it for a user" via Socialite's
 * `userFromToken()`. That shape is **not offered here, deliberately**, because it cannot be made
 * safe with what the providers give us:
 *
 *  - `userFromToken()` calls the provider's userinfo endpoint with the token. The response carries
 *    the user's identity and **no `aud` claim**, so there is nothing in it to compare against our
 *    own client id.
 *  - A token is therefore accepted purely because the provider says it is valid — including a token
 *    minted for a *different* application by the same provider. Anyone able to obtain one for their
 *    own app can present it here and be signed in as that provider's user. This is the standard
 *    token-substitution attack on native social login.
 *  - Even Apple's identity token, which is a real JWT, is not audience-checked: the community
 *    provider constrains issuer, signature and expiry (`IssuedBy`, `SignedWith`, `LooseValidAt`)
 *    and never adds `PermittedFor`.
 *
 * The authorization-code flow has no such hole. **We** perform the exchange, with our own client id
 * and secret, against the provider's token endpoint. A code issued to a different application fails
 * that exchange, because the credentials do not match the code. The client never handles a token we
 * then have to trust.
 *
 * `stateless()` only removes the session-based CSRF state check, which a client with no cookie
 * session cannot participate in. It does not weaken the exchange itself.
