 * Asserts what Socialite actually hands back for each shipped provider.
 *
 * Every other social test fakes the driver, which replaces it entirely: the fake honours whatever
 * raw payload the test supplies, so a test asserting "X links when confirmed_email is present"
 * passes against a driver that never sends one. Two providers shipped unable to authenticate behind
 * a green suite for exactly that reason -- `twitter` resolved to an OAuth 1.0a driver that throws
 * before redirecting, and `linkedin` to a legacy driver whose payload has no email_verified.
 *
 * No network: resolving the driver is enough to catch the class of bug that hid here.
